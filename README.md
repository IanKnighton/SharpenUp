# Sharpen Up

This is a .Net Standard library for working with the [Uptime Robot API](). I had looked into writing my own uptime monitoring tool, but I found this was an easier jumping off point. 

It's currently a WIP. Once I've worked out all of the available endpoints in the API, I'll make it available via NuGet package.
