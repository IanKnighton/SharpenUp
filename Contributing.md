# Contributing to Sharpen Up

While my personal tendency for self deprecation makes me doubt this will ever be used by anyone other than me, I guess it's good GitHub practice to have a contributing document. 

So here we go. 

## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

I have added issue templates to the project. Please, do your best to fit those formats. I understand that they may not meet every case, but I added questions that will help me understand the issue or use case. 

It's important to keep in mind that this project is inextricably linked to someone else's API, so there's only so much that can be done, but I'm always willing to see what I can do on my end.
