# Environment Setup

This is how I setup the environment to run the XUnit test. 

## Example Environment  

I've included a file called `exampleEnv.sh` in the project. This file has the export statements needed for the tests to run. Obviously, you'll need to plug in your own credentials and information, but this should get you started. 

On most Unix based machines, you should be able to set these variables by using the command:

```terminal
source ./exampleEnv.sh
```
